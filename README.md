Demonstrates how to establish a network connection using server ports 

# Network Basics

### Sockets 
Sockets are the foundation of network programming. A socket allows a single computer to serve many different clients as well as to serve many types of different information. This is accomplished through the use of a port.

### Internet Protocols 
Sockets communication takes place via a protocol. Internet Protocol is a low-level routing protocol that breaks data into small packets and sends them to an address across a network.

### TCP - Transmission Control Protocol
TCP is a higher level protocol that manages to string these smaller packets together, sorting and transmitting them in order to effectively transfer the desired data.
